The Tractor
Well, hello and welcome to Wednesdays with Bob.
Remember, even though this isn't a traditional English lesson, 
there are word for word English subtitles 
if you need to turn them on and a complete English transcript in the description below.
Well, hey, today I'm going to talk about this machine here.
I have owned this tractor since 2009.
This is our biggest tractor.
Years ago I would use this tractor to do all the field work in the winter.
I would use it to blow the snow with a snow blower.
But over time I have started more and more to pay the neighbor to do my work for me.
And so this tractor is no longer really needed.
And even though it's somewhat old, it still has a lot of value.
So I don't like having an expensive piece of equipment just sitting in the shed over there doing nothing.
And so what Jen and I have done is we have traded it in.
In fact, it's leaving today.
This tractor is going to get picked up in about 20 minutes and it's going to go away.
And what we've done is we have decided to buy like a utility vehicle for Jen to use on the flower farm, 
something called a John Deere gator.
And we've decided to buy a better lawnmower, something called a zero turn lawnmower.
And that's kind of something that my son will use as well.
As, you know, my son has a lawn mowing business.
So we made a business decision 
that having a big expensive piece of machinery sitting in the shed 
not being used very often is just not a good, 
not a good business decision.
So we made the decision to let it go.
But I'm a little bit sad because I spent a lot of time in that tractor.
In fact,
when I bought that tractor, it had 4,000 hours on it.
Tractors usually have an hour meter that tells you how many hours the engine has been running.
And so it had 4000 and now it has over 5000.
So I spent over 1200 hours in that tractor, working up soil, planting seeds, cutting hay, baling hay, 
doing all the things that farmers do.
And it served me well.
And I'm happy because tractors hold their value.
What that means is that I'm getting almost as much money for it as what I paid for it.
You don't have that happen with cars like that car over there.
It's just going to lose value as time goes by.
So anyways, a little bit of a switch here.
We didn't actually spend any money.
The value of the tractor was enough to help pay for the other two pieces of equipment.
So that's kind of handy.
And I'll show them to you
when they get here at some point.
Jen's pretty excited because right now she uses a lawnmower with a little cart behind it.
And next year she'll be able to use what's called a gator to drive around.
Anyways, thanks for being members.
Hope you're having a good day.
And I'll see you next week with another Wednesdays with Bob video.
Bye.

What to Say in Different Places and Situations
So I've noticed that I don't know what you don't know.
Let me explain.
There are things that you don't know, and I don't know what those things are.
And if I want to help you as a teacher, I need to know about the things you don't know.
And if you saw the thumbnail, you'll see that I want to help you know what to say
when you're at certain places or in certain situations.
And I want to help you know what to ask for
when you're at certain places or in certain situations.
So let's do that.
And here's how I think we should do it.
I'm going to talk about four different places and you can think of more.
And as you think of those places, 
think of what you don't know about 
what you would say if you were at those places.
So the first one would be in a classroom.
What do you say
when you're in a classroom? 
What kinds of things do you ask for 
if you're in a classroom? Put it in the comments below.
And then next week I will try to answer as many of those questions as possible.
Think about
when you're in a store.
What do you say
when you're in a store? 
Are there things you don't know how to say or 
how to describe? Or are there questions 
that you don't know quite how to ask
when you're in a store? 
Put it in the comments below and I'll answer it next week.
Think about, let me see, another location...
Think about a restaurant.
Do you know what to say
when you're in a restaurant? 
If you don't have a menu and you need a menu, do you know how to ask for one?
And then lastly, think about being at someone's house.
When you're at someone's house, do you know what to say? 
Do you know what kinds of questions to ask
when you're at that person's house?
And then I thought we should think of some situations.
So there are different situations where you might not know what to say or what kinds of questions to ask.
Maybe you're on the phone.
I did a lesson about this a few weeks ago.
But maybe you just don't quite know what to say
when you're on the phone sometimes.
Ask me and I'll try to help you.
Another situation might be if a colleague gets a new haircut.
Do you know what to say? Do you know how to give a compliment?
Or maybe you're making an appointment.
Maybe you're on the phone or you're somewhere in person and you're making an appointment.
Do you know what to say and do you know what to ask? Or at least how to put the sentences together.
So here's the plan.
I've given you some example places and some example situations.
You can think of other places and situations and then in the comments below say something like this.
When I'm making an appointment, I don't know how to say and then explain what you don't know how to say.
When I'm at someone's house, I don't know how to ask for.
And then list what you don't know how to ask for.
Maybe I don't know how to ask for another cup of tea or I don't know how to ask for a spoon.
It can be as simple or as complex as you want, but put it in the comments below and then I will read through them.
And then here's how I will sort through.
When you look at the comments below this video, you will see that you can like the comment.
If you like the comment, 
it has more of a chance of being used in next week's video 
where I talk about how to ask these questions, 
how to say what you want to say, 
and how to basically speak proper English in these places and situations.
So it's just as important for you to leave a comment as it is for you to read other people's comments 
and to kind of indicate whether you give it a thumbs up or not, whether you like it or not.
The questions and comments that have the most will be more likely to be answered 
or addressed by me in the next video which will come out next week.
So what are we doing here? 
I want to know what you don't know.
In order for me to know what you don't know, 
you need to put that information in the comments below, ask me about what to say in certain situations,
 the kinds of questions you would ask at different places
And again, my examples are a good starting point.
But you can ask about any situation or any place that you want and I will try my best to answer them.
So good thing you watched to the end.
Now you have to think about what am I going to put in the comments below?
 How many other people's comments 
 am I going to read? Hopefully all of them and give a few likes down there or thumbs up for the ones that you really hope that 
 I will take the time to answer next week.
So thanks for watching.
I hope you are having a good day and I'll see you in part two of this lesson.
I'll put a link up here next week as well to that next lesson where I read the comments and try to answer them as best as possible.
Have a good week.
Bye.
---------------------------------------------------
How to Describe Odd & Unusual Things in English
So there are things in life that are normal, and there are things in life that are not normal, like today's weather.
The weather today is not normal.
It is November 25th, and it is 10 degrees Celsius out here.
In fact, if I was to choose an English word to describe this weather, I would choose the word bizarre.
The weather is bizarre for this time of year.
Normally it's minus one and maybe snowing a little bit, but definitely this weather is bizarre.
When you use the word bizarre to describe something that's not normal, you're really emphasizing that it's really not normal.
So anyways, welcome to this English lesson.
Let's go a few places and let's look at a few more things that are not normal, and I'll teach you some words and phrases you can use to describe them.
So sometimes in English, we simply use the word odd to describe something that isn't how it normally is.
Now, it's pretty normal to have Christmas displays set up in town, but what I find odd about this Christmas display is how early it was set up.
For me, I think that Christmas displays should be set up around December 1st.
I don't feel like they should be here at the beginning of November.
To me, the timing is a little bit odd.
For me, a normal time to set up a Christmas display would be December 1st.
That sounds like a good time.
Christmas is December 25th.
Let's wait until December 1st.
So maybe it's just me, maybe everyone else in the world loves it, but for me, setting up Christmas displays before December 1st seems a little odd, a little bit not normal.
Sometimes in English, we just use the word unusual.
It's unusual to see people eating ice cream cones in November in Ontario, Canada.
Normally we eat ice cream in the warmer months in June, July, August, and even in September.
But I thought I would get an ice cream cone today, even though this is kind of unusual for this time of year.
So again,
when you're talking about something that's not normal in English, you can use the word unusual.
So sometimes in English, we put the word odd and the word unusual together and we say that something is odd and unusual.
These houses behind me are a little bit odd and unusual.
In Ontario, Canada, we don't often paint our houses with vibrant colors like this.
These are really, really cool.
And by the way, if you wanted to buy one, I think this one is for sale.
So sometimes we say something is odd and unusual.
We put the two words together.
I'm going to show you a few more of these.
I think what I like the most about these odd and unusual houses is how the colors are very, very vibrant.
I think I mentioned that already.
Even the fence in front of this house, the house itself is a cool green.
This one behind me is yellow and purple mixed together.
So just very, very cool.
Kind of odd and unusual.
And it doesn't have to be a negative thing.
Some people really like odd and unusual things.
I think sometimes my English lessons are a little bit odd and unusual, but you guys seem to like them.
So sometimes we put those two words together to describe something and say it's odd and unusual.
Sometimes you see something and you just think that's weird.
It's not what you expect to see.
You're like, oh, that's weird.
That's a little bit weird.
I'm going to show you something that I think is a little bit weird.
If you look over here, there is a spot where you can charge an electric vehicle.
But what's kind of weird is it's in an alley, so you can...
I'm not even sure how you would get your car into this little spot.
And then if you look over here, I don't even see a place where you can plug in your electric vehicle.
Like normally there would be some sort of charging station.
So whenever I see this, whenever I'm in this town and I walk by this area and I see this electric car charging area, I think that's weird.
So I came to the town of Grimsby, Ontario today to make this English lesson and there's a lot more traffic than I expected.
I think this is a bit out of the ordinary.
It's one o'clock in the afternoon on a Monday.
I didn't expect to see so many cars driving down the road.
I think it's a little bit out of the ordinary.
In English,
when we say something is out of the ordinary, it's different than how it normally is.
I would think that normally this town is very quiet on a Monday afternoon, that there is very little traffic.
But it seems to me like there's almost a bit of a traffic jam.
If you look down the road, there's this huge row of cars.
I know the cars aren't flying by really quickly, but I think this is definitely out of the ordinary.
I think normally on a Monday afternoon it would be very quiet and there would be very little traffic.
So behind me you can see our local hospital.
And I would say this doctors and nurses work wacky hours.
When you use the word wacky in English, you're describing something that is very abnormal.
Did I teach the word abnormal, yet? Abnormal is the opposite of normal.
But doctors and nurses work wacky hours.
They work during the day, they work at night, they work in the evening, they work early in the morning.
Most people have normal hours.
Most people work from eight to five or seven to four, or if you have a long day, maybe seven to five.
But doctors and nurses definitely work wacky hours.
By the way, we're getting a new hospital.
They're slowly building a new hospital.
The old one is in front here and the new one is just...
I bet you they're about halfway done the new hospital.
It's pretty cool.
Then the doctors and nurses can work wacky hours in that hospital.
Sometimes we just say something is strange.
If you look at this tree behind me, you can see that it has all of its leaves on it still.
And that's a little bit strange for this time of year.
Normally at this point in the fall, you don't see leaves on the trees.
Usually they're all on the ground.
Now there's a lot of leaves on the ground.
That's pretty normal.
But it certainly is strange that this tree still has all its leaves.
It's also a bit strange that the lake doesn't have a little bit of ice on it yet.
If we walk over here, we're by Lake Ontario.
It's a little bit strange.
Normally the lake isn't frozen over, but normally at this time of year there's a little bit of ice along the shore.
Just a tiny bit.
There's probably going to be people from this area who say there's never ice on the lake at this time in November.
But for me, on November 25th, I think it's strange that there's not a little bit of ice there.
And it's definitely strange that that tree has all its leaves on it still.
Well, hey, thank you for watching this English lesson about things that are not normal or how to describe things that are not normal.
If this is your first time here, don't forget to click that red subscribe button.
I think it's over there somewhere.
Leave a comment below.
Give me a thumbs up if this English lesson helped you learn a little bit more English.
And I'll see you next week with another English lesson.
Bye.

Around Town
---------------------------------------------------
Well, hello and welcome to Wednesdays with Bob.
Remember, even though this isn't a traditional English lesson, there are word for word subtitles if you need to turn them on.
English subtitles, of course.
And a complete English description.
And a complete English transcript in the description below.
How many times do you think I'm going to mess that up?
Well, anyways, what a difference a day can make.
That is the phrase I'm using right now.
Yesterday I made my video for my other channel.
The video about how to describe odd things.
And I was wearing a jacket and a short sleeve shirt and I was very comfortable.
Today I'm not.
Today I'm outside wearing, well, a different shirt but the same style of outfit and I'm basically freezing.
To put it in the most informal way, I'm freezing my butt off right now.
So I think because it's windy and because it's cooler, it's just...
Yeah, the wind can make a really big difference
when it's windy on a cold day and then
when it's just a couple degrees colder, it can feel a lot colder.
We call it the wind chill effect here in Canada.
You probably have your own name for it.
I'm not sure what's happening here.
I think, it looks like this building is getting a new roof on it.
At first I thought they were maybe celebrating something with all the red ribbons but then I saw a man up there with a hard hat on and it looks like they are putting a new roof on there.
Oh, and just out of random, random thoughts, there's the pizza place that's...
I think it's been in at least one video, maybe two videos.
I haven't gotten pizza there for a while.
I should go again.
Oh, and then here is Dollarama.
In a previous video someone asked what is a dollar store? Well, a dollar store used to have things that all cost a dollar or less but over time that's changed a little bit.
Now a dollar store, everything's about $5 or less.
I think it's really hard to sell things for only a dollar now it's a little, it's a little tricky.
There are still things in a st....
in a dollar store like Dollarama.
It's behind me now.
I'm gonna go this way.
It's a little...
I'm trying to get out of the wind.
There still are some things that are a dollar or less but most things are like $5 or $2 or $3 or somewhere in that price range.
I do like to go there but you know, some of the stuff is quite cheap, like cheaply made.
There's two ways of using cheap you can say this was really cheap or this is really cheap.
So if I say this was really cheap, it means I didn't pay much for it.
If I say this is really cheap, I might mean it's not made very well and it breaks easily.
Anyways, thanks for being members.
I'm gonna go back to my van and warm up now.
Have a good day.
See you next week with another short little Wednesdays with Bob lesson.
And thanks for being members.
Bye.
---------------------------------------------------
Buses
Well, hello and welcome to Wednesdays with Bob.
Remember, even though there's the loud truck going by, remember, even though this isn't a traditional English lesson, there are word for word English subtitles if you need to turn them on and a complete transcript in the description below.
Well, today I wanted to show you what our school buses look like.
And there are a lot of school buses to look at.
We are walking towards what is apparently a huge parking lot filled with school buses.
I'm not sure why they're here.
I'm not sure if they're brand new and they're just getting them ready for service.
Maybe they park them here during the school day.
I actually have no idea why there is this huge parking lot filled with school buses, but we're going to walk over and have a look.
I'm not sure if school buses look like this in your country.
I'm just going to cross the road quickly here and I wouldn't mind knowing if in the comments below you could let me know.
Now I have to check to make sure there's no train going by.
This is like the craziest Bob video ever in terms of traffic.
I wasn't expecting so much of it, but yeah.
So here we are, school bus parking lot.
I'm just going to walk into here and hopefully no one yells at me.
I was going to stand on the other side of that fence, but then it looked like I could just walk in.
Do school buses look like this in your country? Are they yellow? Ours are all yellow.
There's some shorter ones over there.
I don't know if you can see them.
I don't want to go too far because I don't want to get kicked out of here.
Then we also have little vans that act as school buses sometimes.
So van, short school bus, normal size school bus.
Yeah.
Is that what they look like in your country? I've never actually done a search on the Internet for what school buses look like in Spain or in Vietnam or in the Netherlands.
I have no idea.
I just assumed they were all long yellow buses around the world.
But it'd be interesting to hear from you.
I don't know why they're yellow.
I think because yellow is highly visible.
That would be my guess.
I mean, you can see a bus from a mile away, which is kind of funny because we use kilometers here.
But I think I've mentioned this before.
In English in Canada we still say from a mile away.
Like it means at a really far distance.
Like, wow, you could see that bus coming from a mile away.
Anyways, thanks again for being members and going with me on this little trek across train tracks and looking at yellow buses.
I hope you enjoyed it.
I'll see you next week with another Wednesdays with Bob Video.
Bye.
---------------------------------------------------
Gas
Well, hello and welcome to Wednesdays with Bob.
Remember, even though this isn't a traditional English lesson, there are word for word English subtitles if you need to turn them on, and a complete description or transcript in the description below.
Well, I'm out here getting gas.
It's Tuesday night, I'm getting gas.
It's kind of the end of my day, but also a little bit kind of like the beginning of my day.
I'm on my way back to work because tonight we have parent teacher interviews.
So I'm not sure if you're familiar with what that is.
About halfway through the semester, parents can book an interview time slot and then come in and talk to the teacher about how their son or daughter is doing in my class.
So other teachers as well, of course, we all sit in the library and in the, like, the lounge area of the school.
We all have a little round table and every 10 minutes a new parent or set of parents or guardians will come in and they'll ask how the kid is doing, how the student is doing, what they can do to improve, what they can do to do better in the class.
And I always like to focus on the future
when I'm doing parent teacher interviews.
If there's something in the past that the kid or the student didn't do well on, I'll talk about that for a bit.
But usually I focus on, hey, here's what they can do to improve in the future.
So I'm on my way there, thought I would get some gas.
Got my snow tires, put on the van today and noticed the van was empty
when I picked it up from the garage.
Or almost empty.
It was empty
when I dropped it off.
The mechanic didn't drive around like a crazy person burning up all my gas.
That's not what happened.
So I'm here at the gas station in my local town.
What is gas? $1.47 a liter.
You want to see? Let's have a look down here.
$1.47.9 for regular gas.
Not too bad.
I mean, very expensive compared to what it was a few years ago.
But that's the way it goes, right? Stuff is just expensive.
So that's how much gas is.
So that's how much I pay.
Luckily, I only live about 11km from where I work.
I do live out in the country, but it's a pretty short drive, so I don't use a lot of gas.
This van isn't the greatest, but yes, that is how much I pay for gas.
I'm going to go in the store.
I'm not going to record much of it in the store.
I'm not going to record the person in the store.
But as I walk in, I just want to say thank you for being members.
Thank you for watching these English lessons, and I hope you're having a good day.
So.
So, yeah, this is where I buy my gas every week.
It's a great store.
Great people working here, too.
So anyways, thanks for watching.
I'll see you next week.
Thanks for being members and have a good week.
Bye.
---------------------------------------------------
Motivation
Well, hello and welcome to Wednesdays with Bob.
Remember, even though this isn't a traditional English lesson, there are word for word English subtitles if you need to turn them on, and a complete English transcript in the description below.
Hey, today I wanted to talk about what keeps me going, why I keep making English lessons here on YouTube.
As you know, I passed 2 million subscribers the other day, and a lot of people congratulated me.
But the reality is you have to be very motivated to keep creating videos on YouTube.
And you might be curious what keeps me motivated.
Probably the biggest thing that keeps me motivated is that I like building things.
I like making things.
I really like putting things together.
As a kid, I liked building things out of Lego.
As I got older, I liked making computer programs.
And there are many examples in my life where I like to make things.
So making English lessons kind of ties together nicely the fact that I am a teacher and the fact that I like to make things.
And I always think there's got to be a better way to teach different concepts using video than the way I normally teach it on paper or in a classroom.
So I also like the challenge.
I'll admit there's weeks where I don't feel like making a video and then sometimes I don't, but I'm pretty consistent.
Usually 45 videos a year, usually 45 live streams a year.
And then every once in a while, I take a break if I'm sick or feeling under the weather.
But certainly I am always highly motivated.
I think it's similar to what I say about being in a good mood.
If I have a good night's sleep, if I'm exercising and eating well, I have ideas for lessons.
And then I'm always really excited to actually put those ideas, I was going to say onto tape.
We don't record on tape anymore, but I'm always excited to record the lesson and then kind of edit things together to make it look cool and for it to be interesting.
So, yeah, that just motivates me.
I mean, this sounds altruistic.
I also do like helping people.
I have to admit that I wouldn't be a teacher if I didn't have that character trait, if I didn't have that quality.
When I was visiting Brent in the summer, we talked a little bit about how it's easier for us to stay motivated teaching English on YouTube because we're both teachers.
So we've already chosen a profession where our job is to help people learn stuff.
And so I get to use that character trait as I make videos and as I do my daily job.
So how do I stay motivated? I guess the last thing I would say is I usually just look at the next small job.
I don't usually look at the big picture.
I don't think to myself I have to make 47 videos in the next 52 weeks.
Instead I just think, hey, what cool idea can I come up with to make a video for this Tuesday and for this Friday?
Anyways, thanks again so much for being members.
Thanks to all of you for hanging around and helping to support the channel.
You are awesome.
See you next week with another Wednesday with Bob.
---------------------------------------------------
Has Summer Returned
Well, hello and welcome to Wednesdays with Bob.
Remember, even though this isn't a traditional English lesson, there are word for word English subtitles if you need to turn them on in a complete English transcript in the description below.
Well, I'm out for a walk on October 22 wearing a short sleeved shirt.
It's amazing.
This has been an amazing fall in terms of weather.
Oh, by the way, do you want to see what it looks like if you see me? Here, let me do it this way.
Sometimes
when there's a window, you can get a sense of what I look like
when I'm out in public.
Anyways, it's actually too warm.
I don't know if that's possible, but it's kind of a weird kind of decision you have to make in the morning.
Do I wear a jacket? Do I wear a sweater? For sure.
Do I wear a short sleeve or long sleeve shirt? For sure, the short sleeve shirt.
But it has just been incredible.
I don't know how to describe this.
It feels abnormal.
I guess that's how I would describe it.
I guess I do know how to describe this kind of weather.
It feels a little bit abnormal.
But the advantage is it's a good day for a walk and I can walk outside.
This past weekend, we went for a hike.
It was a great day for a hike.
It was really warm.
By the end, I was just hiking, wearing a t shirt.
So I know that I love winter and that it will come and I will be happy.
But I'll take this in English
when you say I'll take this, it means that you're happy about the situation.
For me, I am definitely happy about this situation, as you can probably tell.
Because one of the other reasons I'm happy about this is the ice rink and the walking track at my local arena where I went skating a few weeks ago.
It's actually closed right now because they have a problem with one of the compressors.
Maybe I'll see if I can find the news article here.
But the arena is closed.
No hockey.
Oh my.
That's not nice for Canadians.
No hockey.
I'm not sure why the walking tracks closed, but maybe it's just not safe or something like that.
But yeah, they're waiting for a part.
They have to fix the compressor or whatever's broken, and then there will be ice again.
So I sharpened my skates, I got a helmet, I did all that and I.
I haven't been skating again.
I went once and then that was it.
Anyways, thanks for being members.
Thanks for joining me on this day that looks like summer, even though it's not.
And I hope you're having a good day as well.
And I hope that wherever you are, you're enjoying the weather.
I just.
My hope for people is always that they can find time to be outside.
I just think getting outside is good for you.
Anyways, thanks for watching.
I'll see you next week with another Wednesdays with Bob.
Bye.
---------------------------------------------------
A Trip
Well, hello and welcome to Wednesdays with Bob.
Remember, even though this isn't a traditional English lesson, there are word for word English subtitles if you need to turn them on, and a complete English transcript in the description below.
Well, it's not very nice out here right now.
In the distance, it actually looks like it's raining.
It's spitting here a little bit.
I just finished my short lesson for my other channel and I wasn't sure I was going to have time to do my Wednesdays with Bob.
So I'll just squeeze it in quickly.
Yeah.
What was I going to talk about? I had a topic in mind.
Oh yeah.
I'm going on a trip.
Every year in the fall my class goes on a trip.
It's a multi day trip.
I did it last year as well, if you remember.
We go to visit a local city and we kind of learn a little bit about how cities are built, how they're designed, urban planning.
We look at cool outdoor nature areas that are built into the city.
We look at walking paths and building what are called walkable communities.
That's a city where there's lots of bike paths and walking paths and those kinds of things.
So it's a fun trip.
I'm leaving tomorrow.
I don't get back till Friday.
You'll be noticing that the live lesson for this week is going to be on Saturday morning.
I'm going to do that
when I get back.
Yeah, this is kind of gross out here.
That's the English term for this kind of weather.
It's kind of gross.
If you look down my driveway, you can see the trees moving in the wind.
If we slowly pan over this way, I'm sure there's raindrops hitting the lens as well.
Leaves on the ground.
Definitely a cool day.
Like not cool like awesome, but cool, like actually cold.
I'm gonna have to start wearing my gloves soon.
It's kind of surprising how quickly we've moved into this kind of weather.
Anyways, about the trip, a couple of days away from the farm, away from Jen and the kids, but I'm sure it'll be nice.
The weather is actually supposed to get warmer for two days, so that'll be nice because we're doing a lot of walking and hiking and outdoor type things.
So hopefully that forecast is actually true.
So anyways, I hope you're having a good day.
I hope these Wednesdays with Bob videos are still enjoyable for you.
It's kind of funny because we just finished the last market last week and then I right away go on a school trip, so I feel like I'm still busy and I won't be able to relax till Saturday morning after I'm done my live stream, but I'm still going to do one because I have a pretty cool topic.
Not going to tell you what it is, you'll have to wait and see.
Anyways, I hope you're having a good day.
Thank you once again for being members.
It's fun to make just a little video where I talk a little bit about random things.
Have a good day.
I'll see you next week with another Wednesdays with Bob.
Bye.

Hi!
Well, hello and welcome to Wednesdays with Bob.
Remember, even though this isn't a traditional English lesson, there are word for word English subtitles if you need to turn them on, and a complete English transcript in the description below.
Well, hi.
How are you doing? It's been a while.
It's been a couple of weeks since I've made one of these Wednesdays with Bob videos.
I missed you.
You probably missed me.
Maybe, I don't know, but I'm definitely doing better now.
So I wasn't super sick.
If you watched my short lesson on my other channel, I kind of explained that I simply was really busy at work and then I got sick.
And in English we call that a double whammy
when two bad things happen in a row.
So yeah, it was not fun.
I don't enjoy being sick.
I don't think anyone actually enjoys being sick.
But for me, especially
when I'm sick, it's hard to get better because I have to talk in order to do my job.
And so sometimes it's a little tricky.
It's a little hard to get better because you're constantly talking for your job.
This camera has a mind of its own today.
It's trying to focus in all different directions or point.
So anyways, what was I going to show you? It is definitely starting to look like fall.
The leaves are starting to turn color.
There are some leaves on the ground.
Some of the grasses have started to turn brown.
But if we look over here, you can see it's still quite green.
It's, uh...
The grass is still quite green.
If you look in the distance, you can see a few more colors.
Things are a little more brown.
I'm certain that...
Apparently if I don't do this for a while, I forget how to turn the camera around.
Certainly in a few more weeks it will be like full on fall.
The grass will be brown in a month and trees will have all their leaves off and stuff like that.
But I'm not sure I'm ready for that yet.
I do enjoy these days.
We've had a really nice fall for growing flowers because we haven't had frost yet.
The first frost might be Thursday night, but Thursday is also our very last day of market.
So hopefully we get through this fall without any frost.
I know that would make Jen super happy.
It would make me super happy because if they call for frost, we go out at night and turn the sprinklers on at like three in the morning.
It's not a very restful evening
when there's frost on the horizon or
when they're calling for frost, so.
Ah.
Yeah, it's been nice.
Anyways, thanks for being members.
I hope you had a good two weeks without me, and I look forward to making more of these videos for you.
Bye.
